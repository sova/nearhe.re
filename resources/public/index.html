      <p class="desc">Nearhe.re local (coming soon) is a new platform connecting people to events,
      products, and services. Nearhere operates on a locational basis and although
      products can be requested across region-lines it's most common for nearhere to
      function as a local tradingpost of sorts.</p>

      <p class="desc">The community calendar features events in the area and you can add
      events. To promote event listings, check the promotions tab on the calendar
      page.</p>

      <p class="desc">Nearhere also features local products for sale. To list and sell a
      product is free and requires minimal id verification.</p>

      <p class="desc">Services on Nearhere require more identity verification, as
      consumers are using our platform to find trusted and authentic service providers.
      Both consumers and service providers wishing to use the services section of
      nearhere must complete the identity verification and agree to the explicit terms of
      use.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <p class="desc">Life by the Calendar The Calendar shows events and users can post
      comments on a whole day or on a specific event. Calendar can be used by just about
      everyone with a basic account.</p>

      <p class="desc">Then there's Products To sell you need a seller ID which
      automatically gets you a Seller's page. Seller ratings are determined by customers.
      Treat them with respect</p>

      <p class="desc">Finally, Services To offer a service there needs to be some extra
      checking of sorts... but once you're verified, the ratings will likely speak for
      themselves...</p>
